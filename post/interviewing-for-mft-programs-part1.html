              <h2 class="blog-post-title">Interviewing for MFT Programs: Part I</h2>
              <p class="blog-post-meta">
                July 2018
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of my six interviews, I noticed some recurring
                components of MFT interviews. I'm going to talk about those components
                and some main takeaways from each...really need something better to grab your attention here.
              </p>
              <h3 class="pt-3">Pre-interview meal</h3>
              <p>
                This is usually not <em>technically</em> part of the interview, but
                usually helpful. You can ask current students about the schedule for the 
                next day and get some helpful tips for how to handle parts that you're
                nervous about. I had done a mock therapy experience at USU previously, but didn't feel very confident about my performance there and I knew that there was a mock therapy experience at my Texas Tech interview. So at the pre-interview meal at Texas Tech, I asked a current student about the mock therapy experience and I got some really helpful insight! ... which I will get to in a minute. 
              </p>
              <h3 class="pt-3">Large group sessions</h3>
              <p>
                At these sessions the faculty introduce themselves and talk about their research interests. It's their chance to brag about the program and try to entice you to come. Pro tip: Be genuinely engaged. Don't be that person that seems to be silently shouting, "I'M BORED OUT OF MY MIND!" while sitting through these introductions. 
                <blockquote class="p-3 mx-5 blockquote text-center text-secondary" style="font-size:1.6rem"><em>I used it as an opportunity to refine the questions I would ask faculty later</em></blockquote>
              </p>
              <p> 
                things like "Why did you get interested in that research?", "What's a project you're really excited about in that field?", "Have you ever thought about doing this with your research?" etc.
              </p>
              <h3 class="pt-3">Students giving brief introductions</h3>
              <p>
                This is your elevator pitch moment! At Texas Tech we were asked to share a random fact about ourselves. One girl said that she could gargle songs. I took my water bottle and set it in front of her, at which point she followed up with, "BUT I only do it with other people". One of the interviewees confessed that he has awkwardly large thighs so he has a particular talent for splitting pants. And you know what? Both of those people got accepted to the program! So you just gotta be you during your interview. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My go-tos for these brief introductions were that (at the time) I was a stay-at-home dad to my two-year-old daughter and that I love nerdy board games. Just before I left for interviews I received a board game I ordered in the mail called Gloomhaven. Gloomhaven is a 22 pound board game...not even joking. It's like the board game version of Dungeons and Dragons but less emphasis on the story arch and much more emphasis on fighting monsters in dungeons with your friends. I was sure to inform the interview group that Gloomhaven was ranked #1 on boardgamegeek.com and that it's an excellent game. I could ramble on about Gloomhaven for a while, but I don't think that's why you came here to read this post.
